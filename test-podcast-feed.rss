    This project was created to provide a simple way to test your HTML styles.
</p>
<p>
    Its main use case is for visualizing how HTML is rendered in different podcast listening apps (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, etc).
</p>

<h1>Testing an H1</h1>

<p>
    This is an anchor tag/hyper link: <a href="https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/">How to start a podcast</a>
</p>

<p>
    This is a paragraph. "To record a podcast, you'll need a microphone, PC or tablet, and audio editing software. Plug your microphone into your computer (or tablet) and record your episode. Once you're done editing it, you'll export the MP3 and upload it to a podcast hosting provider (like <a href="https://transistor.fm">Transistor.fm</a>). Your podcast host will help you distribute your podcast to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and other listening apps."
</p>

<h2>Testing an H2</h2>

<p>
    This is a paragraph with a single line break inside of it. This is before the line break.<br>This is after the line break.
</p>

<h3>Testing an H3</h3>

<p>
    This is a paragraph with a two line breaks inside of it. This is before the line breaks.<br><br>This is after the line breaks.

<p>
    <strong>Here's a block quote</strong>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    Man surprised me most about humanity. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so
    anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to
    die, and then dies having never really lived. -James J Lachard
