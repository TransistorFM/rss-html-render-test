# Testing how HTML in an RSS feed renders in different podcast apps 

When you publish a podcast episode, your show notes are saved as HTML in your podcastâ€™s RSS feed. The issue arises because each podcast app renders HTML differently. To understand this better, I created an RSS feed with various HTML formatting elements and tested it across several popular podcast apps.

- [View test RSS feed](https://transistorfm.github.io/rss-html-render-test/test-podcast-feed.rss)

The results from this test will be published in this blog post:
